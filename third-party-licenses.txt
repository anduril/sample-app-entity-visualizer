This package contains the following license:

@react-leaflet/core Copyright 2020 Paul Le Cam and contributors (“Licensor”)

Hippocratic License Version Number: 2.1.

Purpose. The purpose of this License is for the Licensor named above to permit the Licensee (as defined below) broad permission, if consistent with Human Rights Laws and Human Rights Principles (as each is defined below), to use and work with the Software (as defined below) within the full scope of Licensor’s copyright and patent rights, if any, in the Software, while ensuring attribution and protecting the Licensor from liability.

Permission and Conditions. The Licensor grants permission by this license (“License”), free of charge, to the extent of Licensor’s rights under applicable copyright and patent law, to any person or entity (the “Licensee”) obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to do everything with the Software that would otherwise infringe (i) the Licensor’s copyright in the Software or (ii) any patent claims to the Software that the Licensor can license or becomes able to license, subject to all of the following terms and conditions:

- Acceptance. This License is automatically offered to every person and entity subject to its terms and conditions. Licensee accepts this License and agrees to its terms and conditions by taking any action with the Software that, absent this License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by Licensor.

- Notice. Licensee must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this Software from Licensee, with or without changes, also receives the License and the above copyright notice (and if included by the Licensor, patent, trademark and attribution notice). Licensee must cause any modified versions of the Software to carry prominent notices stating that Licensee changed the Software. For clarity, although Licensee is free to create modifications of the Software and distribute only the modified portion created by Licensee with additional or different terms, the portion of the Software not modified must be distributed pursuant to this License. If anyone notifies Licensee in writing that Licensee has not complied with this Notice section, Licensee can keep this License by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice. If Licensee does not do so, Licensee’s License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end immediately.

- Compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws.

  1. Human Rights Principles.

     (a) Licensee is advised to consult the articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact that define recognized principles of international human rights (the “Human Rights Principles”). Licensee shall use the Software in a manner consistent with Human Rights Principles.

     (b) Unless the Licensor and Licensee agree otherwise, any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to (i) Section 1(a) regarding Human Rights Principles, including the breach of Section 1(a), termination of this License for breach of the Human Rights Principles, or invalidity of Section 1(a) or (ii) a determination of whether any Law is consistent or in conflict with Human Rights Principles pursuant to Section 2, below, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Hague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration (the “Rules”); provided, however, that Licensee may elect not to participate in such arbitration, in which event this License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end immediately. The number of arbitrators shall be one unless the Rules require otherwise.

     Unless both the Licensor and Licensee agree to the contrary: (1) All documents and information concerning the arbitration shall be public and may be disclosed by any party; (2) The repository referred to under Article 43 of the Rules shall make available to the public in a timely manner all documents concerning the arbitration which are communicated to it, including all submissions of the parties, all evidence admitted into the record of the proceedings, all transcripts or other recordings of hearings and all orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal, subject only to the arbitral tribunal's powers to take such measures as may be necessary to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral process pursuant to Articles 18, 33, 41 and 42 of the Rules; and (3) Article 26(6) of the Rules shall not apply.

  2. Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or entity for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any Human Rights Laws. “Human Rights Laws” means any applicable laws, regulations, or rules (collectively, “Laws”) that protect human, civil, labor, privacy, political, environmental, security, economic, due process, or similar rights; provided, however, that such Laws are consistent and not in conflict with Human Rights Principles (a dispute over the consistency or a conflict between Laws and Human Rights Principles shall be determined by arbitration as stated above). Where the Human Rights Laws of more than one jurisdiction are applicable or in conflict with respect to the use of the Software, the Human Rights Laws that are most protective of the individuals or groups harmed shall apply.

  3. Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor (and any other contributor) against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including Licensor’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee’s use of the Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles.

- Failure to Comply. Any failure of Licensee to act according to the terms and conditions of this License is both a breach of the License and an infringement of the intellectual property rights of the Licensor (subject to exceptions under Laws, e.g., fair use). In the event of a breach or infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the Laws of any jurisdiction to which Licensee is subject. Licensee also agrees that the Licensor may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against Licensee through specific performance (or similar remedy under Laws) to the extent permitted by Laws. For clarity, except in the event of a breach of this License, infringement, or as otherwise stated in this License, Licensor may not terminate this License with Licensee.

- Enforceability and Interpretation. If any term or provision of this License is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this License or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction; provided, however, subject to a court modification pursuant to the immediately following sentence, if any term or provision of this License pertaining to Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable against Licensee by a court of competent jurisdiction, all rights in the Software granted to Licensee shall be deemed null and void as between Licensor and Licensee. Upon a determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent permitted by Laws, the court may modify this License to affect the original purpose that the Software be used in compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws as closely as possible. The language in this License shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.

- Disclaimer. TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THIS SOFTWARE COMES “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR AND ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, UNDER ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM.

This Hippocratic License is an Ethical Source license (https://ethicalsource.dev) and is offered for use by licensors and licensees at their own risk, on an “AS IS” basis, and with no warranties express or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by Laws.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @anduril-industries/lattice-sdk@1.2.0

This package contains the following license:

# Anduril Lattice Software Development Kit License Agreement 

## Terms and Conditions  
 
This is the Anduril Lattice Software Development Kit (SDK) License Agreement (the “License Agreement”).  
 
1. **Introduction**
  - 1.1  "Anduril" means Anduril Industries, Inc., organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of 
the USA with principal place of business at 1400 Anduril, Costa Mesa, California 92626, USA.  
  - 1.2  "Lattice" means the Anduril Lattice™ software stack for devices, as made available by Anduril, as updated from time to time.  
  - 1.3  The  Anduril  Lattice  Software  Development  Kit  (referred  to  in  the  License  Agreement  as  the  "SDK"  and  specifically  including  the  
Lattice system files, packaged APIs, and Anduril APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The 
License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Anduril in relation to your use of the SDK.  
  - 1.4  A  "compatible  implementation"  means  any  use  that  (i)  is  compatible  with  Lattice;  or  (ii)  successfully  is  validated  by  Anduril  to  be  
compatible with Lattice. The determination of a compatible implementation is solely at the discretion of Anduril.   

2. **Accepting this License Agreement**

  - 2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License 
Agreement. 
  - 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.  
  - 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the 
laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.  
  - 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that 
you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you 
may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity. Use of the SDK on hardware owned 
by an entity such as your employer binds your employer to this License Agreement.

3. **SDK License from Anduril**

  - 3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Anduril grants you a limited, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-
exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Lattice.  
  - 3.2  You  may  not  use  this  SDK  to  develop  applications  for  other  platforms  (including  non-compatible  implementations  of  Lattice)  or  to  
develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of 
Lattice, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.  
  - 3.3 You agree that Anduril or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights 
that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark 
law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Anduril reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.  
  - 3.4  You  may  not  use  the  SDK  for  any  purpose  not  expressly  permitted  by  the  License  Agreement.  Except  to  the  extent  required  by 
applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, 
disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.  
  - 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open-source software license are governed solely by 
the terms of that open-source software license and not the License Agreement.  
  - 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Anduril provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions 
of  the  SDK  may  be  incompatible  with  applications  developed  on  previous  versions  of  the  SDK.  You  agree  that  Anduril  may  stop  
(permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Anduril's sole discretion, 
without prior notice to you.  
  - 3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Anduril's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain 
names, or other distinctive brand features.
  - 3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that 
may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.

  - 4.1 Anduril agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software 
applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

applicable  law,  regulation  or  generally  accepted  practices  or  guidelines  in  the  relevant  jurisdictions  (including  any  laws  regarding  the  
export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).  
  - 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for Anduril Lattice users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of 
those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information, it must do so securely. You may not use a third-party’s Lattice 
account information or credentials to access Lattice.  
  - 4.4  You  agree  that  you  will  not  engage  in  any  activity  with  the  SDK,  including  the  development  or  distribution  of  an  application,  that

third party including, but not limited to, Anduril or any fixed or mobile communications carrier.  
  - 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Anduril has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, 
or resources that you create, transmit or display through Anduril Lattice and/or applications for Lattice, and for the consequences of your 
actions (including any loss or damage which Anduril may suffer) by doing so.  
  - 4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Anduril has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your 
obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and 
for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Anduril or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

developer credentials.

6. **Privacy and Information**
 
  - 6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Anduril may collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not

resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated

  - 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between

subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data 
(either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant owner and/or terms of service.  
    - 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit

Licensee must cause any modified versions of the Software to carry prominent notices stating that Licensee changed the Software. For clarity, although Licensee is free to create modifications of the Software and distribute only the modified portion created by Licensee with additional or different terms, the portion of the Software not modified must be distributed pursuant to this License. If anyone notifies Licensee in writing that Licensee has not complied with this Notice section, Licensee can keep this License by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice. If Licensee does not do so, Licensee’s License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end immediately.

- Compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws.

  1. Human Rights Principles.

     (a) Licensee is advised to consult the articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact that define recognized principles of international human rights (the “Human Rights Principles”). Licensee shall use the Software in a manner consistent with Human Rights Principles.

     (b) Unless the Licensor and Licensee agree otherwise, any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to (i) Section 1(a) regarding Human Rights Principles, including the breach of Section 1(a), termination of this License for breach of the Human Rights Principles, or invalidity of Section 1(a) or (ii) a determination of whether any Law is consistent or in conflict with Human Rights Principles pursuant to Section 2, below, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Hague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration (the “Rules”); provided, however, that Licensee may elect not to participate in such arbitration, in which event this License (and all rights licensed hereunder) shall end immediately. The number of arbitrators shall be one unless the Rules require otherwise.

     Unless both the Licensor and Licensee agree to the contrary: (1) All documents and information concerning the arbitration shall be public and may be disclosed by any party; (2) The repository referred to under Article 43 of the Rules shall make available to the public in a timely manner all documents concerning the arbitration which are communicated to it, including all submissions of the parties, all evidence admitted into the record of the proceedings, all transcripts or other recordings of hearings and all orders, decisions and awards of the arbitral tribunal, subject only to the arbitral tribunal's powers to take such measures as may be necessary to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral process pursuant to Articles 18, 33, 41 and 42 of the Rules; and (3) Article 26(6) of the Rules shall not apply.

  2. Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or entity for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any Human Rights Laws. “Human Rights Laws” means any applicable laws, regulations, or rules (collectively, “Laws”) that protect human, civil, labor, privacy, political, environmental, security, economic, due process, or similar rights; provided, however, that such Laws are consistent and not in conflict with Human Rights Principles (a dispute over the consistency or a conflict between Laws and Human Rights Principles shall be determined by arbitration as stated above). Where the Human Rights Laws of more than one jurisdiction are applicable or in conflict with respect to the use of the Software, the Human Rights Laws that are most protective of the individuals or groups harmed shall apply.

  3. Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor (and any other contributor) against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including Licensor’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee’s use of the Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles.

- Failure to Comply. Any failure of Licensee to act according to the terms and conditions of this License is both a breach of the License and an infringement of the intellectual property rights of the Licensor (subject to exceptions under Laws, e.g., fair use). In the event of a breach or infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the Laws of any jurisdiction to which Licensee is subject. Licensee also agrees that the Licensor may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against Licensee through specific performance (or similar remedy under Laws) to the extent permitted by Laws. For clarity, except in the event of a breach of this License, infringement, or as otherwise stated in this License, Licensor may not terminate this License with Licensee.

- Enforceability and Interpretation. If any term or provision of this License is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this License or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction; provided, however, subject to a court modification pursuant to the immediately following sentence, if any term or provision of this License pertaining to Human Rights Laws or Human Rights Principles is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable against Licensee by a court of competent jurisdiction, all rights in the Software granted to Licensee shall be deemed null and void as between Licensor and Licensee. Upon a determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, to the extent permitted by Laws, the court may modify this License to affect the original purpose that the Software be used in compliance with Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws as closely as possible. The language in this License shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.

- Disclaimer. TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THIS SOFTWARE COMES “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR AND ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, UNDER ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM.

This Hippocratic License is an Ethical Source license (https://ethicalsource.dev) and is offered for use by licensors and licensees at their own risk, on an “AS IS” basis, and with no warranties express or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by Laws.
